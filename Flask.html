            <h2>Season of Discovery Flasks</h2> <img src="Rate-my-raid/Images/Flasks/Flask.jpg" alt="Flasks">
            <p>Here we will be looking at flasks what they do and where we get them most of the flasks we will be covering were added in the Season of Discovery version of the game if you are coming here as a Classic player do not worry we will be covering those as well later on! A small disclaimer you will need to have the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=171/alchemy">Alchemy</a> profession to be able to make these for yourself however there is nothing stopping you from gather or buying the reagents and giving them to an alchemist so that they can craft these for you and if that still fells like a lot of work you can simply buy them of the auction house but be warned this gets expensive fast!
            </p>
            <h3>Flask of the Old Gods</h3> <img src="Rate-my-raid/Images/Flasks/Old Gods.jpg" alt="flask-of-the-old-gods">
            <p>Flask of the old Gods is a on use item which will grant the user 100 stamina and increase their defence value by 10 for 2 hours. You may only have one flask effect active at a time this effect also pesists through death</p>
            <p>Flask of the old Gods is the one stop shop for all your tanking needs it increases your stamina by 100 which equals out to about 1000 extra HP you will see more value from this as well because the stamina granted from the flask also benefits from all % stat inscreases from other buffs so even though the flask would only increase the tanks HP pool by 1000 when all buffs and world buffs are applied you will find it is closer to 1250 because of the % increases as well. another thing that is overlooked alot of that you will also gain an extra 10 Defence from this flask which all tanks will get a slight damage increase from due to one of their tanking runes.

            <h3>Flask of Madness</h3> <img src="Rate-my-raid/Images/Flasks/Madness.jpg" alt="flask-of-madness">
            <p>Flask of Madness is a on use item which grants the user 50 attack power for 2 hours you may only have one flask effect active at one time this effect also persists through death</p>
            <p>Flask of Madness was Blizzards answer to the melee damage dealers complaints that there was not a melee damage flask in classic world of warcraft not that they really needed one in the first place! This flask will grant you an extra 50 attack power which as we know from looking at other melee consumables our main objective is to get our hands on as much attack power as possible weather that is from getting more Strength, Agility or just pure attack power. There are some small use cases however where you might want to not use this flask and consider using a HP flask like Flask of the old Gods or Flask of the titans if you find yourself in a fight where you are taking a large amount of unavoidable damage.

            <h3>Flask of Ancient Knowledge</h3> <img src="Rate-my-raid/Images/Flasks/Ancient.jpg" alt="flask-of-ancient-knowledge">
            <p>Flask of Ancient Knowledge is a on use item that will grant the user 180 spell damage for 2 hours. You may only have one flask effect active at a time this effect also pesists through death</p>
            <p>Flask of Ancient Knowledge is a stronger version of the flask of Supreme Power and is the main pick for all caster damage dealers as our main goal is to get as much extra spell damage to increase our damage there is also a special mention to the Retirbution Paladin with this flask as being a class that deals both physical and magical damage you can pick from either the flask of Ancient Knowledge or the flask of madness depending on what build you are playing or whichever is cheaper as they are both give around the same damage.

            <h3>Flask of Unyielding Sorrow</h3> <img src="Rate-my-raid/Images/Flasks/Sorrow.jpg" alt="flask-of-unyielding-sorrow">
            <p>The Flask of Unyielding Sorrow is a on use item which grants the user increased Healing done by 80, Spell damage by 27 and 12 mana per 5 seconds for 2 hours. You may only have one flask effect active at a time this effect also pesists through death</p>
            <p>Just as all the other flask focus on each roll in World of Warcraft from Tanks to ranged damage dealers and now even melee damage dealers the healers now also have a new flask! This flask grants the healer a little bit of everything but the main talking points are the large Healing power as well as the mana per 5 as you will find in the later raids in season of discover the incoming damage is high and the fights can be long so having a flask that contributes to both your healing power as well as your mana regeneration is great.

            <h4>Classic Flasks</h4>
            <p>Above we spoke about all of the new flasks added for Season of Discover but as that game mode is a seasonal game mode and we do not know what the future holds for it we will also be going over the flask found in the Classic servers as well</p>
            <h5>Flask of the Titans</h5> <img src="Rate-my-raid/Images/Flasks/Titans.jpg" alt="flask-of-the-titans">
            <p>Flask of The Titans is a on use item that grants the user 1200 health for 2 hours. You may only have one flask effect active at a time this effect also pesists through death</p>
            <p>This will be the main flask for both tanks and melee damage dealers alike for two reasons the first reason is simply that there isnt an alternative for melee damage dealers and secondly in classic the class design was much more simple that what we have come to expect with later version of the game to the point where if you were a class with high armour you might be expected to throw on a shield and tank some stray trash enemys from time to time so the extra health is never a bad thing.

            <h5>Flask of Supreme Power</h5> <img src="Rate-my-raid/Images/Flasks/Power.jpg" alt="flask-of-supreme-power">
            <p>Flask of Supreme Power is a on use item that grants the 150 spell damage for 2 hours. You may only have one flask effect active at a time this effect also pesists through death</p>
            <p>Caster in the classic version still get a damage flask but as this is flat spell damage it means it will be used by all magic damage types and is also the biggest damage gain from any consumable in classic so be prepared to pay a premium for this.

            <h5>Flask of Distilled Wisdom</h5> <img src="Rate-my-raid/Images/Flasks/Wisdom.jpg" alt="flask-of-distilled-wisdom">
            <p>Flask of Distilled Wisdom is a on use item that grants the user 2000 mana for 2 hours. You may only have one flask effect active at a time this effect also pesists through death</p>
            <p>As a healer this will be your main flask as sadly there is no flask that will grant you more healing power. There is a special note to be made with this flask that was discovered by the speed running community where if you have multiple Flasks of Distilled Wisdom and were out of mana you could drink another not only refreshing the durration of the buff but also granting you the 2000 mana so if you have gold burning a hole in your pocket and want to show off then feel free.

            <h5>Flask of Chromatic Resistance</h5> <img src="Rate-my-raid/Images/Flasks/Resistance.jpg" alt="flask-of-chromatic-resistance">
            <p>Flask of Chromatic Resistance is a on use item that will increase the users resistances to all schools of magic by 25 for 2 hours. You may only have one flask effect active at a time this effect also pesists through death</p>
            <p>Flask of Chromatic Resistance is a flask with some very certain use cases as you will find going into the first raid in Classic world of warcraft "The Molten Core" almost every boss and every trash enemy deals fire damage to the point when you reach the final boss it is suggested that your tanks have a fire resistance gear set ready. It is for theses sort of encounters where Flask of Chromatic Resistance is needed and typically is something would be handed out by the guild or raid if it is needed.

            <h2>Season of Discovery Flasks</h2>
            <p>Here we will be looking at flasks what they do and where we get them most of the flasks we will be covering were added in the Season of Discovery version of the game if you are coming here as a Classic player do not worry we will be covering those as well later on!
            </p>
            <h3>Flask of the Old Gods</h3>
            <p>Flask of the old Gods is a on use item which will grant the user 100 stamina and increase their defence value by 10 for 2 hours. You may only have one flask effect active at a time this effect also pesists through death</p>
            <p>Flask of the old Gods is the one stop shop for all your tanking needs it increases your stamina by 100 which equals out to about 1000 extra HP you will see more value from this as well because the stamina granted from the flask also benefits from all % stat inscreases from other buffs so even though the flask would only increase the tanks HP pool by 1000 when all buffs and world buffs are applied you will find it is closer to 1250 because of the % increases as well. another thing that is overlooked alot of that you will also gain an extra 10 Defence from this flask which all tanks will get a slight damage increase from due to one of their tanking runes.</p>
            <h3>Flask of Madness</h3>

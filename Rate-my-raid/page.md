# Webpage
This is my webpage project, where I am creating a page using desktop-first design. It will showcase my new skills in web development as I learn them.

This file will store all updates I make to this project before I put it on GitHub.

## Folder Setup
*Olly's note: You can delete this whole section from your file*
- Create a new folder in "IntroToWebDev" called "Webpage". **DONE 01/05**
- Inside the "Webpage" folder should be the following files:
    - "page.md" **DONE 01/05**
    - "index.html" **DONE 01/05**

## Project Brief
- Has at least one image that you have permission to use. The image must be accessible to screen readers. **DONE 01/05/**
- Has at least one external link **DONE 01/05**
- Contains a nested list. **DONE 01/05**
- Contains some large blocks of text. **DONE 01/05**
- Uses Lorem Ipsum or ChatGPT for placeholder text generation. **DONE01/05**
    - If using ChatGPT, you may want to add a disclaimer on your site somewhere.

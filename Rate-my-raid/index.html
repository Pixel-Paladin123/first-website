            <h2>Hello and welcome to Rate My Raid!</h2>
            <p>The goal of this is site is for the WoW community with the help of <a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/" target="_blank">warcraftlogs</a> to rate both Guild and PuG raids (comming soon).
                We will be rating raids on multiple factors from anything from the raid leaders attitude, Weather or not consumables are provided what they were the amount and why</p>
           
            
            <section class="Main description">
                <h3>What we are trying to do</h3>
             <p>In World of Warcraft you will eventually find yourself in organised content or "End game" content which will involve you going into a raid to fight and kill the bosses to aquire end game loot. Finding or making groups that cab meet the requierments to clear these raids can be quite daunting for new players and tedious for existing players which is where Pick up Groups come into play (better known as pugs) These are can range from anything from a group of friends wanting to clear the end game content and looking for more players to come along, Guilds who are missing a handfull of players for their raid team or even entire communities with making pug groups be their sole objective. </p>

             <p>The issue we have with there being so many ways for you to be able to get into a group and see the end game content is that with so many options sometimes there are some bad performers and this can be down to a number of things from a bad compistion, not starting on a agreed on time, people leaving mid raid, disagreements in loot distributions or a general lack of preparedness. It wont take you long going through discord posts or forum threads to come across other players horror stories of green geared tanks running face first into a boss only for them to die before a single heal was cast or joining what was advertised as a guild run only to find 5 players hiding in the back with no gear and then everything they happen to need is magically reserved.</p>

             <p>So now that you are aware of some of the things that can cause you to have a bad time in game the question now is how can we avoid this? Well the good news is thats where we come in! This Websites main function will be for the World of Warcraft community to rate any raids they take part in weather its a pug or a guild raid and it will be rated on a list of things you can see below from weather or not food is provided for the raid, If you need to change flasks because of a tactic your group wants to do if the flask and replacment flask is provided or not, If you need to change spec for a certain fight are the needed consumables provided or not and last but not least if world buffs are provided or not and how frequent they are to rebuff players if at all.

            <p id="consumables-text">Here we will look into what consumes (if any) were provided for the raiders by the raid leads here is a list of what we are mainly looking for with links to take you to dedicated pages to show you what sort of things are considered to be linked to a main consumable group for example if you want to know what sort of food items we are looking to consider for buff food clicking on the "Food" link either in the list or on the nav bar will take you to a page telling you everything you need to know from where to get it, what it does and which is better.</p>

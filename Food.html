            <h2>Food Buffs</h2>
            <p>Here we are going to look into what Elixirs are in the game, who uses what and where to find them or even make them. A small disclaimer you will need to have the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=171/alchemy" target="_blank">Alchemy</a> profession to be able to make these for yourself however there is nothing stopping you from gather or buying the reagents and giving them to an alchemist so that they can craft these for you and if that still fells like a lot of work you can simply buy them of the auction house but be warned this gets expensive fast!</p>
            <h3>Prowler Steak</h3>
            <p>Prowler Steak is a on use Food item which will grant the user 25 strength and 10 Stamina after eating it for 10 seconds for 15 minutes or until death (This is a Season of Discovery only item)</p>
            <p>As a Strength user this is going to be the best buff food you will have access to in season of discovery. Strength is the main stat that will determin your damage as it is converted into attack power at a scale of double so if you have 25 strength that will work out at 50 attack power so the overall aim will be to get as much strength as possible to increase how much attack power you have</p>
            <h3>Sunrise Omelette</h3>
            <p>Sunrise Omelette is a on use food item that grants the user 29 spell damage, 55 healing and 10 Stamina after eating for 10 seconds for 15 minutes or until death (This is a Season of Discover only item)</p>
            <p>As a caster damage dealer or healer Sunrise Omelette is going to be the best food that you can get your hands on and because it is used for both damage and healing this can be quite expensive however like all season of dsivery cooking items the materials to make this are easy to obtain so you can always aquire them yourself if the Auction house prices are to much for you</p>
            <h3>Filet o' Flank</h3> 
            <p>Filet o' Flank is a on use food item that grants the user 25 Agility and 10 stamina after eating for 10 seconds and lasts for 15 minutes or until death (This is a Season of Discovery only item)</p>
            <p>As a Agility user this will be the best food you have access to</p>
            <h3>Smoked Desert Dumplings</h3>
            <p>Smoked Desert Dumplings is a on use Food item which will grant the user 20 strength after eating it for 10 seconds for 15 minutes or until death</p>
            <p>As a strenth user this is going to be the second best buff food you will have acces to in Season of Discovery or the best food if you are playing Classic. Strength is the main stat that will determin your damage as it is converted into attack power at a scale of double so if you have 25 strength that will work out at 50 attack power so the overall aim will be to get as much strength as possible to increase how much attack power you have</p>
            <h3>Blessed Sunfruit</h3>
            <p>Blessed sunfruit is a on use Food item which will instantly grant the user 10 strength for 10 minutes or until death</p>
            <p>Blessed sunfruit is going to be one of the first food items you will encounter on your end game journey and is the weakest but also cheapest of consumbables for a melee dps so if you are concious of funds or maybe going into a raid where you predict alot of deaths this can be a good option so that you atleast still have something. One thing to mention that this food does differntly to other buff foods is that you will gain the buff instantly on use and dont need to wait 10 seconds so its always good practice to have some of these on hand just incase you forget and need something in a pinch</p>
            <h3>Grilled Squid</h3>
            <p>Grilled Squid is a on use food item which grants the user 10 Agility after eating for 10 seconds lasts 10 minutes or until death</p>
            <p>As a Agility user Grilled Squid is going to be the second best food you have access to if you are playing Season of Discovery however if you are playing on Classic servers this will be the best agility food you have access to and is your second best option if the cost of smoked desert dumpling is high</p>
            <h3>Dragonbreath Chili</h3>
            <p>Dragonbreath Chili is a on use food item that will grant the user a buff with a chance on hit to breath fire in a cone infront of you (Make sure to use this AFTER eating normal buff food)</p>
            <p>Dragonbreath Chili is a a different sort of food item where as other food items on the list will give the user an increas in their stats Dragonbreath Chili does not do this instead it will give you a chance to breath fire in a cone infront of you on every melee hit you land. This is incredibly strong for all melee classes just for the simple fact its free damage with no down side. One of the main interactions we like about Dragonbreath Chili is also that it has a 100% spell power scaling meaning that if you were to using something like the Elixir of Greater Firepower you can increase the damage of the fire breath. Another and more important interaction with Dragonbreath Chili is the application you must make an effort to always eat this AFTER you have already eaten a buff food because if you do this the other way round the Dragonbreath buff will be removed and you will have essentially wasted a Dragonbreath Chili and here we are not in the business of doing that!</p>
            <h3>Darkclaw Bisque</h3>
            <p>Darkclaw Bisque is a on use food item that will grant the user 10 spell power after eating for 10 seconds last for 10 minutes or until death</p>
            <p>As a caster damage dealer this is your second best buff food if you are playing Season of Discovery but if you are playing Classic this is as good at it gets thankfully for casters the buff granted here is pure spell damage so it will effect all schools of magic so there are no restrictions on who can use this unlike some of the Elixirs</p>
            <h3>Runn Tum Tuber Surprise</h3>
            <p>Runn Tum Tuber Surprise is a on use food item which grants the user 10 intelect by 10 after eating for 10 seconds lasts 10 minutes or until death</p>
            <p>As a caster damage dealer this is the cheapest and weakest of the buff foods you have access to that being said this can still be a very valuable buff food to have as having more raw  intelect will increase your mana pool as well as contribute to spell critical rating and also directly interact with any % stat buffs your gourp will be casting</p>
            <h3>Nightfin Soup</h3>
            <p>Nightfin Soup is a on use food item that grants the user 8 mana every 5 seconds (Also know as MP5) after eating for 10 seconds lasts for 10 minutes or until death</p>
            <p>As a healer you have some choices in what buff food you want to use based on the kill times you see if you find the bosses are dieing fairly fast you wont need to worry to much about mana regeneration because the boss will be dead before it becomes a major factor so you could look at using something like Darkclaw Bisque. However if you find yourself in later parts of the game and some of the later raids it might be that boss fights will last long and mana regeneration becomes more of a factor so you would then want to look the Nightfin Soup to help you with that.</p>

            <h4>Feasts</h4>
            <p>Here we will be looking at feast what they do and where you can get them Feasts were introduced in the Scarlet enclave phase for Season of Discovery and for that reason we will not be spending to much time on these</p>
            <h5>Specklefin Feast and Grand Lobster Banquet</h5>
            <p>Specklefin Feas and Grand Lobster Banquet are feast items which will require the user to place and then everyone in the party and raid will be able to interact with after eating from the feast for 10 seconds the player will gain 40 Attack power, 23 Spell damage, 44 Healing Power and 10 Stamina lasts for 45 minutes or until death.</p>
            <p>Both the Specklefin Feast and Grand Lobster Banquest provide the exact same buff and is intended to used as a catch all alternative providing buffs for all types of damage deals and healers so there is no right or wrong option when it comes which one to use and is more of a question of which one is cheaper on the auction house at the time. It is the expected standard that guilds and raid groups should be providing feasts for their raiders especially after a failed attempt on a boss however the eagle eyed among you will notice that the buff on the feast is slightly less than what you would have if you were to use a specific buff food like Prowler Steak, Sunrise Omelette or Filet o' Flank</p>

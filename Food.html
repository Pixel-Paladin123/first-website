            <h2>Food Buffs</h2>
            <p>Here we are going to look into what Elixirs are in the game, who uses what and where to find them or even make them. A small disclaimer you will need to have the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/skill=171/alchemy" target="_blank">Alchemy</a> profession to be able to make these for yourself however there is nothing stopping you from gather or buying the reagents and giving them to an alchemist so that they can craft these for you and if that still fells like a lot of work you can simply buy them of the auction house but be warned this gets expensive fast!</p>
            <h3>Prowler Steak</h3>
            <p>Prowler Steak is a on use Food item which will grant the user 25 strength for 15 minutes or until death</p>
            <p>As a strength user this is going to be the best buff food you will have access to in season of discovery. Strength is the main stat that will determin your damage as it is converted into attack power at a scale of double so if you have 25 strength that will work out at 50 attack power so the overall aim will be to get as much strength as possible to increase how much attack power you have</p>
            <h3>Smoked Desert Dumplings</h3>
            <p>Smoked Desert Dumplings is a on use Food item which will grant the user 20 strength for 15 minutes or until death</p>
            <p>As a strenth user this is going to be the second best buff food you will have acces to in Season of Discovery or the best food if you are playing Classic. Strength is the main stat that will determin your damage as it is converted into attack power at a scale of double so if you have 25 strength that will work out at 50 attack power so the overall aim will be to get as much strength as possible to increase how much attack power you have</p>
